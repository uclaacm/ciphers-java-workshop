# ciphers-java-workshop
A collaboration workshop between ACM Cyber & ACM TeachLA focusing on implementing classical ciphers in Java! The workshop was taught to high school students in TBD.

## Slides
The slides explain Ceasar and Vigenère ciphers, along with the real-life applications of ciphers. You can find the slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-bCpPzhor2Be6eFI90ioucnsveL2WCfnuERQb-hwEPU/edit?usp=sharing).

## Demos
The demos for the wrokshop involves showing string manipulation and conditions in Java. You can find the demos [here](./demos/README.md).

## Project
The project for the workshop involves implemented a Caeser cipher encoder-decoder in Java! You can find the project [here](./project/README.md).

To compile the program to `.class` files, run the following command in the project directory root:
```
javac -d . Main.java
```

To run the compiled `.class` files, run the following command in the project directory root:
